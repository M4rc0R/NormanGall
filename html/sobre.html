                reports are long, detailed and accompanied by extensive critical analysis. In the 1960s, he wrote hundreds of articles on topics such as rural education in Puerto Rico, labor problems in the San Juan waterfront, small factories in the
                Puerto Rican town of Aibonito, guerrillas in Colombia, economic development in Bolivia, mining in Bolivia, violence in Nicaragua, the Duvalier regime in Haiti, political assassinations in the Dominican Republic, Maoist guerrillas in Peru,
                guerrillas in Venezuela, guerrillas in Guatemala, the relationship between State and Church in Cuba, the arrest of Juan Peró in Rio de Janeiro and social tensions in Juarez City. He was the first to reveal the CIA's role in the assassination
                of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1961, and the first to reveal in detail the peasant revolt in southern Peru. His reports on human rights include “Slaughter in Guatemala” [The New York Review of Books, May 20, 1971] and “São Domingo:
