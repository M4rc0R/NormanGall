            <p>“King Kong in Brazil: State bankruptcies and bank failures.” Braudel Papers. No. 15 (1996). Special edition. Inflation now is low but the institutions of chronic inflation are alive and making enormous claims on government resources. Since
                the Real Plan was launched, massive federal support has gone into sustaining operations of five of the 10 biggest banks that were since merged into other institutions or are still in deep trouble, in one of the most complex banking crises
                in financial history. Brazil’s big trouble now is a spreading cancer of bank failures and state bankruptcy. </p>
